Natural Language Processing Final Project: AI Code Detector



**Install Guide**

Download the data for task A or B from 

https://huggingface.co/datasets/DaniilOr/SemEval-2026-Task13

or

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/daniilor/semeval-2026-task13

as parquets into the data/task_a folder, naming "task_a_test_set_sample", "task_a_training_set_1", "task_a_validation_set"



Then create a VENV in your folder, running python 3.12.0, and install requirements.txt


depending on your memory constraints, you can then try example.py, which runs a basic modernBERT implementation, or import it to colab and run it there
